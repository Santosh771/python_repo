Python is primarily an interpreted language, but it also has elements of compilation in its execution process. Let’s break it down:

How Python Works:
Source Code to Bytecode (Compilation Phase):

When you run a Python script, the Python interpreter first compiles the source code (.py files) into an intermediate format called bytecode.
This bytecode is a platform-independent, low-level representation of the code.
The bytecode is stored temporarily in memory or as a .pyc file (in the __pycache__ directory) for future use.
Bytecode Execution (Interpretation Phase):

The compiled bytecode is executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM), which is the interpreter.
The PVM translates bytecode into machine code specific to the host system and executes it.
Why is Python Considered Interpreted?
Python executes the bytecode using an interpreter (PVM) at runtime, which gives it its interpreted nature.
You do not need to manually compile Python code; the compilation to bytecode happens automatically and transparently.
Key Characteristics:
No Explicit Compilation:

Unlike languages like C or Java, where you compile code manually, Python handles the compilation internally.
Platform Independence:

Python’s bytecode can run on any system with a compatible Python interpreter, making it cross-platform.
Dynamic Typing:

Python determines variable types at runtime, a feature typically associated with interpreted languages.
Comparison with Compiled Languages:
Aspect	Compiled Languages (e.g., C)	Interpreted Languages (e.g., Python)
Execution Speed	Faster	Slower (due to runtime interpretation)
Compilation Step	Manual (source to machine code)	Automatic (source to bytecode)
Portability	Limited to compiled platform	Highly portable (via interpreter)
